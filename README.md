Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.
Project Euler, Google Code Jam are some of the projects that inspire Rosalind.

In this repo I will add solution codes to computational biology problems that are posted at Rosalind website.
